You will be able to use the `sl` command for manipulate docker images.
The build process is split into:
1. `sl build  |service_name|` - builds the image using the standart docker-compose build.
2. `sl serve  |service_name|` - starts a local server with reload capability, useful when working with frontend.
3. `sl shell  |service_name|` - bashes into a running container, useful for running tests.
4. `sl stop   |service_name|` - stops the docker image.
5. `sl push   |service_name|` - pushes the image to a remote container manager.
6. `sl deploy |service_name|` - deploys a service to a cloud provider.

The image also includes `pip` packages located in `pipable`, they can be built and published by using:
1. Update the version number in `pyproject.toml`.
2. `sl pip-build |service_name|` - builds a .whl file with poetry.
3. `sl pip-publish |service_name|` - publishes the package to PyPi by default.

This does assume that you have .env file with PyPi username and password.
