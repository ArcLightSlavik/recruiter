You will be able to use the `sl` command for manipulate docker images.
The build process is split into:
1. `sl setup  |service_name|` - gets all of the required files for the image to work.
2. `sl build  |service_name|` - builds the image using the standart docker-compose build.
3. `sl serve  |service_name|` - starts a local server with reload capability, useful when working with frontend.
4. `sl shell  |service_name|` - bashes into a running container, useful for running tests.
5. `sl stop   |service_name|` - stops the docker image.
6. `sl push   |service_name|` - pushes the image to a remote container manager.
7. `sl deploy |service_name|` - deploys a service to a cloud provider.
